## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Download Git") must be installed on your operating system.

## Notes about this fork / CSS cleanup

This repository has been modified to remove the "Testimonials" and "Clients" sections
from `index.html` and to scope/clean the portfolio CSS. The generated site directory
`_site/` is intentionally ignored in this branch. To build and preview locally:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

If you make changes to `assets/css/style.css` and want to see them reflected in the
site preview, rebuild with `bundle exec jekyll build` or restart `jekyll serve`.
